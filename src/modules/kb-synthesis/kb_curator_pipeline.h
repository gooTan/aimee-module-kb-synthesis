/* kb_curator_pipeline.h: the curator stage registry + per-pass runner.
 *
 * The curator drain used to hardcode an if-chain of stages gated on the previous
 * stage doing no work — which starved downstream stages (index_claims,
 * detect_contradictions) behind a large extract backlog. This replaces that with a
 * data-driven ordered registry: a drain pass flows each work-item through every
 * enabled stage. It is also the seam a GUI pipeline editor toggles/reorders, so
 * different applications compose their own pipeline from the same stages. */
